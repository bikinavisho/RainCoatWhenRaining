# RainCoatWhenRaining
A Stardew Valley mod that automatically equips rain gear to your character on days that it is raining. 

## Overview
This mod, at the start of each day, checks to see if the weather is rainy/stormy. If it is, it will automatically change the hat/boots/shirt of your farmer into the raincoat equivalents. If you are currently wearing a hat or boots, it will unequip them, adding them to your inventory. If your inventory is full, it will drop them beside you. At the end of the day, when your farmer goes to bed, it will change your farmer back into the outfit they were wearing (including hat/boots/shirt) before the rainy day. The rain hood and rain boots will be removed from the player's inventory on days it is not raining. 
Essentially it's replicating the natural behavior of you, once realizing it is rainy outside, deciding to put on your rain coat, hood, and rain boots before heading outside.
